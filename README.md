#Welcome to UNITE!

The **UNified Interface for Translations from English** project serves as an experimental repository for translated Baha'i text from languages other than English. 

Currently, translations of English Baha'i texts into other languages, which exist in more than one source, may have multiple translations of the same English text. We hope this repository serve as an interface, to which different translations of the same text can be linked by a unified indexing system. This system is an easy reference point for translators to *search, compare and study* different translated texts, the translator can choose their favorite translation of a text or improve on existing translations if so desired. 

If you wish to contribute to this project, please review these guidelines. This may add a little extra time to your translation process, however, we believe that, in the end, everyone will benefit.

Happy Translating!
