Prayers of Ecstasy
Selections from the Baha’i Sacred Writings


p.78


>When you present yourselves in the meetings, before entering them, free yourselves from all that you have in your heart, free your thoughts and your minds from all else save God, and speak to your heart. That all may make this a gathering of love, make it the cause of illumination, make it a gathering of attraction of the hearts, surround this gathering with the Lights of the Supreme Concourse, so that you may be gathered together with the utmost love:


p.79


>O God, dispel all those elements which are the cause of discord, and prepare for us all those things which are the cause of unity and accord.

>O God, descend upon us Heavenly Fragrance and change this gathering into a gathering of Heaven!

>Grant to us every benefit and every food.
Prepare for us the Food of Love!
Give to us the Food of Knowledge!
Bestow upon us the Food of Heavenly Illumination!

>In your hearts remember these things, and then enter the Unity Feast.

>`Abdu’l-Baha

p.78

>你等出席會議入席前，
當放下心中的一切，
除了上帝，放空思緒與念頭，
並與心靈對話。
讓眾人竭力成就一個愛之聚會，
讓它成為光明之肇因，
並維繫眾心，
而天堂眾英靈之光得以環繞這聚會，
如此你等當可聚首於大愛中：

p.79

>上帝啊！ 驅散所有釀成不和之因。
並為我等備妥促成和諧與團結之一切。

>上帝啊！ 降賜吾等天國的芬芳。
令這聚會成為天堂的聚會。

>賞賜我們一切善美和糧食。
提供吾等愛之糧！
賜予吾人智慧之糧！
惠賜吾儕天國光輝之糧！

>牢記這些在你心，再進團結之饗宴。

>阿博都巴哈
