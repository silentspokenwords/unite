Intone, O My servant, the verses of God that have been received by thee, as intoned by them who have drawn nigh unto Him, that the sweetness of thy melody may kindle thine own soul, and attract the hearts of all men. Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his chamber, the verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty shall scatter abroad the fragrance of the words uttered by his mouth, and shall cause the heart of every righteous man to throb. Though he may, at first, remain unaware of its effect, yet the virtue of the grace vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exercise its influence upon his soul. Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation of God been decreed by virtue of the Will of Him Who is the Source of power and wisdom.

我的僕人啊！像親近祂的人們那般地吟誦你承享自上天的詩節吧！
如此，你甜美的聲韻將燃起你的靈魂，並吸引兆民的心。
凡獨處室內，吟誦上天所啟示之詩節者，
其口所頌之話語的芬芳，將由那全能者的散播天使們，播散四方，
並使每位正直者的心，為之振奮。
初時，他或許未能察覺其影響力，
然而，賜予他的恩澤終將影響其靈魂。
這是由那力量與智慧之源泉的祂，其意旨所命定的，神聖天啓之奧秘。
