Ruhi Book 3 p.7

According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the children is indispensable and obligatory. It followeth that teachers are servants of the Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this task, which is the same as worship. You must therefore offer praise with each breath, for you are educating you spiritual children.

>根據明確的聖典，教導兒童是責無旁貸和應盡的義務。教師是主上帝的僕役，因為他們挺身履行此任務乃視同為崇拜上帝，你應無時無刻讚美上帝，因為你是在教導你靈性的孩子。
